function [w,x] = MidpointDifferential(a,b,N,initialApprox, f)
% MIDPOINTDIFFERENTIAL gives an array which approximates the solution to a
% differential equation using Midpoint method.
%
%
% INPUT(S):
%
% a: Our lower bound to the range of t in the differential equation y' =
% f(t,y).
%
% b: Our upper bound to the range of t in the differential equation y' =
% f(t,y).
%
% N: The number of points you want to approximate in the function.
%
% InitialApproximation: The value of y(a).
%
% f: The differential equation that we are trying to solve that is of the
% form y' = f(t,y).
%
% OUTPUT(S):
%
% w: An array that approximates the solution to y. It is indexed as
% followed: w(i) = y(ti).
%
% x: An array that holds all the ti values. This is useful for later
% creating an approximate polynomial to our estimation.
